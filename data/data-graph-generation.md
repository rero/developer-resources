# Data graph generation

Data graph generation was done to resolve common problems about finding a user in a specific organisation/library.

Sometimes it's difficult to manually parse JSON files to find a specific piece of data.

To avoid this problem we created a [script that generates a graph from JSON files](https://forge.o9.re/ODT/rero-ils-graphs/src/branch/master/by_json).

## Usage

To use it, please read [the README file](https://forge.o9.re/ODT/rero-ils-graphs/src/branch/master/by_json/README.md).
