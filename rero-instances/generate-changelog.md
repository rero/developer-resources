# Generating a changelog

Use [PyChangelog][1].

It's a Python tool that reads a github project event data through Github's
API and generates a changelog with sections about fixed issues, and merged PRs.

[1]: https://github.com/rero/pychangelog

## Install

1. Clone the repo : `git clone https://github.com/rero/pychangelog.git`.
2. Run `poetry install` to install dependencies.

## Usage

1. Edit the following in `config.ini`:
   1. `repo`: the name of the project (`rero-ils`, `rero-ils-ui`, `sonar`, ...)
   2. `from_tag` and `to_tag`: Title of latest release (e.g. `v1.10.0`) and
   title of next release (e.g. `v1.11.0`).
2. Run `poetry run ./changelog.py --token <your-github-token>`
3. Check `PYCHANGELOG.md` for your changelog
4. Copy the generated changelog from `PYCHANGELOG.md` to the top of your
project's `CHANGELOG.md`.

:warning: With poetry >1.5.0, `poetry run ./changelog.py` might not work because of path problems. If that happens, just put `changelog.py` in a folder and run it from there. E.g. `poetry run /changelog/changelog.py`

### Verification

1. After generating a changelog, check carefully that:
   * Only the new release has been added to the `CHANGELOG.md` file
   * The listed issues and PRs correspond to the ones that have been
   closed/merged for this release (not more, not less!)
1. Manually fix any blatantly unclear or non-pertinent info in the generated
list. If necessary, edit the issue directly in Github and generate the
changelog again. Sometimes issues are closed without being fixed. If someone
closed an issue and forgot to tag it as `stale`, `wontfix` or `duplicate`, the
generator will add it to the changelog.
1. Once everything looks fine, save the file and keep on with the release!

### GitHub's API Token

You need to generate a *personal access token* to avoid the API's limit. You
can do that on <https://github.com/settings/tokens>.

You also need the correct permissions on the repository for which you want to
read the events through the API.
